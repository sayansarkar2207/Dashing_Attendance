Dashing_Attendance

We are designing a AI based face recognization system for taking attendance of the employees and record their body temperature, to predict any covid positive case.
This is safe in comparison to fingerprint attendance as all the people need to touch the same fingerprint sensor, which is not favourable for the pandemic conditions as need to minimise social contact.
Moreover the device will also register the person's temperature to keep a check on them and predict any abnormal condition.

For Temperature dectection and display

Materials required:
1) Arduino Uno
2) Jumper wires ( as required )
3) ISB-TS45D Infrared Thermopile Sensor x 1
4) Nokia 5110 LCD Display Module â€“ Blue x 1
5) Resistor 4.75K ohm x 2
6) Capacitor 100nF x1
7) Breadboard ( small ) x 1 { if required }
